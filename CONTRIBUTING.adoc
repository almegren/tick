Tick is implemented using the api of `java.time` and an understanding of the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html[concepts behind java.time] will be very useful when working with tick, 
because tick entities are java.time entities (Instant, LocalTime etc). 

The most common questions relate to 'calling xyz method doesn't work with Instants, why not?' The `top tips` section in the README gives the answer and solutions.

java.time has a much larger API than tick. tick only aims to cover what we feel are the most commonly occurring date-time use-cases. At this point (5+ years into the life of tick) we don't feel we are missing any functions. If you feel you have a good candidate for addition, please argue why you think it is an everyday need as part of the issue. 

Where tick doesn't provide the api you need,
you can look at the java.time api (most readily available as https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[cljc.java-time]) to see if there alternatives. 

If you cannot find the help you need in the tick documentation, it 
is quite likely that someone will have had the same query and had it resolved on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java-time[Stack Overflow].

We welcome PR's with tests, but may be a bit slow in getting to them as we are very busy!
